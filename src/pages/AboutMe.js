      <p>Always curious, my time away from keyboard is spent reading science focused news articles, going on long
        walks
        with my husband and dog, or imagining what another world could be like with my DND group. </p>
      <p>I’m just starting in my web development career, but I’ve been working in tech for most of my life.
        Currently
        employed at Apple Inc. repairing relationships and devices one customer at a time. My mantra during every
        interaction
        is <span class="about-me">“What can we accomplish together today?"</span>. If you have a project you want to
        build or problem you need to solve I'd love to get involved. Community means everything. Lets connect!</p>
